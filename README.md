## Cardmeister `<playing-card>`

This project uses the amazing **Cardmeister** library to render the playing cards. The lightweight JavaScript file defines a `<playing-card>` web component.  It contains all 52 card SVGs, creating them on the fly without needing to load or store separate image files.
