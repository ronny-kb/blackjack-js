# Blackjack.js

A simple Blackjack game I built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game lets you play one vs one against an automated dealer with basic betting and proper Blackjack rules.

## Features

- One vs one Blackjack against the dealer
- Adjustable betting before each round
- Hit and Stand actions
- Smart hand summing
- Payouts include 1:1 and 3:2 for a natural Blackjack
- Real-time UI updates and chip count tracking
- Works on desktop and mobile

## Notes

I kept things simple and focused on core frontend skills like DOM manipulation, state management, and modular code. The layout uses CSS and a bit of styling, including a frosted-glass modal.

## Cardmeister `<playing-card>`

This project uses the amazing **Cardmeister** library to render the playing cards. The lightweight JavaScript file defines a `<playing-card>` web component.  It contains all 52 card SVGs, creating them on the fly without needing to load or store separate image files.
